                <p>Halo is a legendary gaming franchise that began all the way back in 2001. In the begining it was a
                    simple console fps (first-person shooter). However despite its simplicity it would redefine what it
                    meant to be a shooter on console. With industry defining controls, open enviroments and addictive couch
                    co-op it became a must have game almost immediately. Back then it was only available for Microsoft's console the
                    'Xbox' however 20 years later and it would have seen release on mobile, pc and would even see movie and TV content.
