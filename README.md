# Halo History

My Website is designed to Introduce and Reinform possible customers of the Halo Franchise. The Site will work as a historical look over the franchises 20 years and encourage more people to get interested and involved in the series. I will use different forms of media such as Images and Video to sumarise more information in an entertaining format for each game in the series. I will also offer a newsletter sign up form, anyone who signs up will recieve weekly updates regarding the newest game yet to be released. It will also provide different story related facts and value beyond just news.

## UX

As stated by the introduction, the site will aim to draw in people to gain interest in the Halo franchise. To do this, the site will use a simple homepage to encourage new users to find out more. At the same time it will be easy for pre-existing users to find the content that they may be interested in. 

The colour scheme is based on a simple white and deep blue to contrast the text for ease of reading.
