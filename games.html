                        <p>Developed by Bungie, Halo: Combat Evolved is the sci-fi game responsible for revolutionizing
                            the console first-person shooter genre. Assuming the role of the elite UNSC Spartan soldier
                            known as the Master Chief, Halo: Combat Evolved quickly drops the player onto a mysterious
                            alien ringworld. As the Chief, your objective is to uncover Halo’s terrible secrets and
                            fight back against mankind's sworn enemy, the Covenant.

                            Players enjoy an experience positively packed with combat as they battle on foot and in
                            vehicles, both inside and outdoors with a vast array of Human and Covenant weaponry.
                            Incredible mission variety allows players to enjoy battling solo or cooperatively with a
                            friend, or engage in intense shootouts in splitscreen multiplayer combat.</p>

                        <p>After the events of Halo: Combat Evolved, Master Chief and Cortana return to Earth in an
                            attempt to stop the onslaught of the Covenant, a terrifying and aggressive alien
                            civilization, bent on destroying the human race.

                            Developed by Bungie, Halo 2 sees the player not only resuming the role of the Master Chief,
                            humanity’s best defense against the unyielding Covenant forces, but also assuming the
                            identity of the Covenant Elite known as the Arbiter. Players wield dual weapons, employ
                            previously undiscovered Covenant armaments, and pilot new vehicles as they battle
                            intelligent enemy AI and all-new alien opponents in exotic environments.</p>
